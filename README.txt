This project implements a 2D human pose estimation and gesture recognition system
using MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV. It can detect and classify various human gestures including
hand raises, waving, squatting, and crossed arms. 
It will support custom dataset recording and evaluation, as well as HaGrid dataset evaluation
and MPII Pose dataset evaluation.
